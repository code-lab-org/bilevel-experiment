# Bi-level Experiment (bilevel-experiment)

## Introduction

This project contains the source code for a distributed software application to investigate a bi-level model of design.

## Getting Started

This project includes a Maven `pom.xml` file which simplifies dependency management. If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse, import as an existing Maven project.

The application can be launched from the `Main.java` file; however, it requires some command line arguments to configure.
